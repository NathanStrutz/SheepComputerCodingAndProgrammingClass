# What We Learn

All SHEEP high school classes have an official syllabus. Feel free to [contact](contact) me for an official copy.

Coding & Programming has 4 major units. Every week has a participation score (6 pts, or about 20% of your grade) and a homework score (15 pts, about 40%), and every quarter we have a large 100 point project (about 40% of your total grade).
